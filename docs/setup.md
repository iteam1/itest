CUDA support is available across a wide range of NVIDIA GPU series. As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, here are some of the notable GPU series that support CUDA:

`GeForce GTX Series`: This series includes GPUs like GTX 1000 and GTX 900 series. They offer CUDA support for general-purpose computing tasks.

`GeForce RTX Series`: This series includes GPUs like RTX 3000, RTX 2000, and RTX 1000 series. These GPUs not only support CUDA but also introduce hardware support for ray tracing and AI-related tasks through features like RT Cores and Tensor Cores.

`NVIDIA Titan Series`: The Titan series GPUs are high-performance GPUs designed for both gaming and professional workloads. They provide robust CUDA support and are often used for machine learning, scientific simulations, and other compute-intensive tasks.

`NVIDIA Quadro Series`: The Quadro series is tailored for professional workstations and applications. They offer extensive CUDA capabilities and are used in fields like 3D rendering, CAD, and scientific simulations.

`NVIDIA Tesla Series`: The Tesla series GPUs are specifically designed for high-performance computing and data center applications. They have a strong emphasis on CUDA performance and are widely used in scientific research and data analysis.

`NVIDIA A100`: A part of the NVIDIA Ampere architecture, the A100 is a data center GPU designed for AI and high-performance computing workloads. It features dedicated Tensor Cores for AI tasks and offers extensive CUDA capabilities.

It's important to note that CUDA support can vary across different models within a series. Also, newer GPU models may have been released after my last update, so I recommend checking the official NVIDIA website or other reliable sources for the latest information on CUDA support for specific GPU models.
